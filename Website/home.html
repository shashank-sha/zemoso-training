Photoshop is a wonderful but an enormous program. It is unlike other software
interfaces which emulate virtual typewriters or graphing paper. Photoshop
creates artists virtual studio (or) darkroom. For a beginner there should be a
support for building up his skills for working on photoshop. This site would help
the beginners to understand the foremost (or) basic steps to be taken , such as
developing a work environment, opening different kinds of files, how to work
with different types of edit functions etc. A basic photoshop website would help
the beginners in a better way to work with the program.</font>
