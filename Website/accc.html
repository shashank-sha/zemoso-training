  <h3>Marquee Tool</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    The images in Photoshop are stored pixel by pixel, with a code indicating the color of each. The image is just a big mosaic of dots. Therefore, before you can do anything in Photoshop, you first need to indicate which pixels you want to change. The selection tool is one way of doing this. Click on this tool to select it, then click and drag on your image to make a dotted selection box. Hold shift while you drag if you want a perfect square or circle. Any pixels within the box will be affected when you make your next move. If you click and hold on this tool with your mouse button down, you will see that there is also an oval selection shape, and a crop tool .
